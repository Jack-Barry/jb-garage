# @jb-garage/bootstrap-react

Bootstrap components built with React by Jack Barry

ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§ This project is currently under a _lot_ of construction ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§

## Why?

1. I wanted to build a component library just for the hell of it
1. I wanted a more modern (functional components and hooks-based) Bootstrap React
   component library built from the ground up with TypeScript support in mind
1. I wanted to have nice "off the shelf" components that still allow for a lot of
   flexibility in usage
1. That's it

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm i @jb-garage/bootstrap-react
```
